# "FB Messenger" Remake

## Description

This is a little in-browser remake of a popular messaging app.

Currently, it's only one sided, and doesn't actually send or save any messages. It's just a little site that makes it *look* like you're sending messages to another person. I thought it was fun, nonetheless.

This "app" is in no way affiliated with Facebook. Facebook is &copy; Facebook.
